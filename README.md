# Personal site 1997

This repo is my first, complete website that I ever built in 1997 and was hosted on `members.aol.com` and
spread across 2 of my screennames' webspace (`neospike` and `elspikeo`) + some pages were hosted on Geocities.
This distribution was due to the fact that AOL didn't provide a ton of space for this stuff so it was my
workaround, even though it did violate the ToS.

These files have since been massaged to work properly on a single host.

This site was authored using Adobe Page Mill + some Alien Skin Photoshop plugins. I don't really recall what
else was used. It's been 25 years.

## A note about the content

This repo contains some audio files that I ripped from CDs at the time and looped using SoundEdit 16, so yeah,
I don't own that music. This is primarily music by Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel, Primus and Aphex Twin.

Pretty much everything else except for the satinic Bill Gates gif and the "made on a mac" image were created
by me.
