  <P>I am Spike. You are currently in the area where I describe who and what
  I am. I live in Linden, NJ and I like computers. I own a PowerMac 7600,
  but I did most of my page at work on my PowerMac 8500 with 200 megs of
  memory. I think of myself as a master Photoshop user which is what I used
  to make this page and all of the other components of it. Other things that
  I used to make these pages are as follows:</P>

  <P>Well this is getting long so I will just not list anymore stuff. I like
  anime, computers, computer games, playing guitar, playing drums and playing
  bass. I like to play with hacking and phreaking programs but I don't really
  do anything useful with them. Please spread the word of my site by telling
  people and by adding a bookmark or by adding a link to your site to mine.
  If you have a site that you think I would like, then tell me! I might add
  your site to my list of links.</P>
